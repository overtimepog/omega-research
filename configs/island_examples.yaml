# EvolveAgent Island-Based Evolution Configuration Examples
# Different configurations for various use cases

# Configuration for Maximum Diversity (Many Islands, Frequent Migration)
# Use this when you want to explore the search space thoroughly
# Good for: Complex problems, avoiding local optima, long runs
max_diversity:
  database:
    num_islands: 10                   # More islands = more diversity
    migration_interval: 25            # More frequent migration
    migration_rate: 0.2               # Higher migration rate
    population_size: 1000
    archive_size: 200

# Configuration for Focused Exploration (Few Islands, Rare Migration)
# Use this when you want deeper exploration within each island
# Good for: Problems with clear structure, shorter runs
focused_exploration:
  database:
    num_islands: 3                    # Fewer islands = deeper exploration
    migration_interval: 100           # Less frequent migration
    migration_rate: 0.05              # Lower migration rate
    population_size: 500
    archive_size: 50

# Configuration for Balanced Approach (Default Settings)
# Use this as a starting point for most problems
# Good for: General use, medium-length runs
balanced:
  database:
    num_islands: 5                    # Balanced number of islands
    migration_interval: 50            # Moderate migration frequency
    migration_rate: 0.1               # Moderate migration rate
    population_size: 1000
    archive_size: 100

# Configuration for Quick Exploration (Small Scale)
# Use this for rapid prototyping and testing
# Good for: Small problems, quick experiments
quick_exploration:
  database:
    num_islands: 3
    migration_interval: 20
    migration_rate: 0.15
    population_size: 200
    archive_size: 30

# Configuration for Large-Scale Evolution (High Performance)
# Use this for complex problems requiring extensive search
# Good for: Complex optimization, long evolutionary runs
large_scale:
  database:
    num_islands: 15                   # Many islands for parallel exploration
    migration_interval: 75            # Balanced migration timing
    migration_rate: 0.08              # Conservative migration rate
    population_size: 2000             # Large populations
    archive_size: 300

# Guidelines for choosing parameters:
#
# num_islands:
#   - More islands = more diversity, slower convergence
#   - Fewer islands = faster convergence, risk of premature convergence
#   - Recommended: 3-10 for most problems
#
# migration_interval:
#   - Lower values = more frequent knowledge sharing
#   - Higher values = more independent evolution
#   - Recommended: 25-100 generations
#
# migration_rate:
#   - Higher values = faster knowledge propagation
#   - Lower values = preserve island diversity longer
#   - Recommended: 0.05-0.2 (5%-20%)
#
# Rule of thumb:
#   - Complex problems → More islands, less frequent migration
#   - Simple problems → Fewer islands, more frequent migration
#   - Long runs → More islands to maintain diversity
#   - Short runs → Fewer islands for faster convergence

# Note: All configurations above should be combined with reward model settings.
# Default reward model configuration (applies to all examples):
rewardmodel:
  model_type: api                          # Only "api" is supported (vLLM removed)
  model_name: "qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct"  # OpenRouter model
  base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
  api_key: "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"         # Set via environment variable
  proposal_score_threshold: 5.5
  max_retries: 5
  retry_delay: 5

# Default evolution settings (applies to all examples):
# Evolution settings
diff_based_evolution: true
allow_full_rewrites: false
max_code_length: 100000
max_diff_generation_retries: 3            # Maximum retries for LLM diff generation failures

# Changes documentation settings
generate_changes_doc: true                # Auto-generate changes.md explaining code evolution
changes_doc_max_retries: 3                # Maximum retries for changes documentation LLM generation
